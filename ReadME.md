## Summer Internship Web Development Projects
During my summer internship, I developed two websites, showcasing my skills in both front-end and back-end web development. The front-end is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without any frameworks), while the back-end is implemented with PHP.

Feel free to explore the sites here:
